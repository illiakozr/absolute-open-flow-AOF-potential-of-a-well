# absolute-open-flow-AOF-potential-of-a-well
Application  for determining the flow of potential well (AOF - Absolute Open Flow or AOFP - Absolute Open Flow Potential) for the results of the classical isochronous test.

Input data: <br/>
a) set: well flow rate [m3 / h] - duration of well flow rate [h] - pressure at the end of expenditure [bar]; assumption: a flow rate of zero means that the well is closed. <br/>

Output data: <br/>
a) a graph illustrating the method for interpreting the results of the classical isochronous test; <br/>
b) potential flow rate of the well [m3 / h]. <br/>
